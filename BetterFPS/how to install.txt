HOW TO INSTALL ON WINDOWS
- locate your 'Project Zomboid' installation folder (by default should be something like: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid")

- open the "\zombie\iso" folder

ex:
Program Files (x86
└───Steam
    └───steamapps
        └───common
            └───ProjectZomboid
                └───zombie
                    └───iso


- in another window open the mod folder (by default should be: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\108600\3022543997\mods\BetterFPS\media\")


ex:
Program Files (x86
└───Steam
    └───steamapps
        └───workshop
            └───content
                └───108600
                    └───3022543997
                        └───mods
                            └───BetterFPS
                                └───media


- select the most relevant folder for you config (this is just obvious preset, you can use 4k even in 1080p this will still increase FPS):
 * \PotatoPC\ if you use a resolution lower than 1080p
 * \1080p\ if your use a 1080p resolution
 * \4k\ if you use a resolution bigger than 1080p

* \Original\ is a recompiled version of the original file

Inside each folder there is another folder \zombie\iso\

- copy this folder (or the content)

- replace the existing folder (or file) from Project Zomboid

ex: 
replace "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid\zombie"
with "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\108600\3022543997\mods\BetterFPS\media\1080p\zombie"

This will overwrite the original file with patched one
